# How To Use Music Sorter

This guide will help you use the Music Sorter to organize your music library.

---

### 1. Create or Select a Folder
First, you need to select the folder where you want to organize your music files. You can either choose an existing folder or create a new one.

### 2. In the Terminal, use `cd` to navigate to the folder or drag & drop it
Navigate to your folder in the terminal by using the `cd` (change directory) command. Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the folder into the terminal to automatically input the path.

```bash
cd /path/to/folder
```

### 3. Run the `create_genre_folders` script in the folder
Now that you are in the correct folder, run the `create_genre_folders.sh` script to create all the necessary genre folders.

```bash
./create_genre_folders.sh
```

**Note:** Do not close the terminal after running the script. The terminal must remain open for the next steps.

### 4. DO NOT close the terminal
If you close the terminal, you will need to use the `cd` command again to select the folder to continue. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/folder
```

### 5. Add the music files to be sorted into the `XtoScan` folder
Now, add all the music files you want to sort into the `XtoScan` folder. This folder will be used by the script to scan and sort the music files.

### 6. Run the `sort_music.sh` script in the folder
Run the `sort_music.sh` script to move the songs based on their genre tags into the appropriate folders.

```bash
./sort_music.sh
```

### 7. Done
After the script has been executed, all songs should be in the correct genre folder. If everything worked correctly, the process is complete.

### **Troubleshooting:**

#### If tracks end up in the `Uncategorized` folder:
If music files end up in the `Uncategorized` folder, it means that the genre of the track could not be detected. In this case, you will need to modify the `sort_music.sh` script to correctly assign the genre.

1. Open the `sort_music.sh` script in a text editor.
2. Find the section where genres are assigned and adjust the script. For example:

   Change:
   ```bash
   "Indie Dance"|"Alternative Dance"|"Dance")
       echo "Dance"
       ;;
   ```

   To:
   ```bash
   "Indie Dance"|"Alternative Dance"|"Dance"|"Dance & House")
       echo "Dance"
       ;;
   ```

3. Save the script and run it again:

   ```bash
   ./sort_music.sh
   ```

Now, previously uncategorized files should be sorted correctly.
